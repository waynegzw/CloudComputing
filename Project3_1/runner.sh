# Answer question 1-6 by completing the bash commands inline.
# Do NOT use java, python, etc. for these questions.

# Question 1
# How many rows in million_songs_metadata.csv contain 'Aerosmith' (Case sensitive)?
# Write your bash commands/code to process the dataset and output a
# single number to standard output.
answer_1() {
	grep -P 'Aerosmith' million_songs_metadata.csv | wc -l

# Question 2
# What is the total number of track_id(s) in million_songs_metadata.csv with
# artist_name containing "Bob Marley" (Case sensitive)?
# Write your grep commands/code to process the dataset and output a
# single number to standard output.
answer_2() {
	awk 'BEGIN{FS = ","}; {print $7}' million_songs_metadata.csv | grep -p 'Bob Marley' | wc -l

# Question 3
# How many rows in million_songs_metadata.csv c'''ontain 'The Beatles' (Case sensitive) on column 7?
# Write your awk commands/code to process the dataset and output a
# single number to standard output.
answer_3() {

# single number to standard output.

# to merge the two files into the file million_songs_metadata_and_sales.csv
# in current folder.
# No output is needed here.

# Find the artist with maximum sales using the file million_songs_metadata_and_sales.csv.
# The output of your command(s) should be the artist name.
# NOTE: Artists can have many different artist_names, but only one artist_id,
# which is unique to each artist. You should find the maximum sales based
# on artist_id, and return any of that artist_idâ€™s valid artist_name as the result.

# Write a SQL query that returns the trackid of the song with the maximum duration.
# Complete the corresponding method(s) in MySQLTasks.java.

# Complete the corresponding method(s) in MySQLTasks.java.

# Question 9

#Question 11
# Which artist has the third-most number of rows in table songs?
